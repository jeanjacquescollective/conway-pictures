						<!-- <h1 class="header-text">Description</h1>
						<div class="paragraph">
							Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the
							British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. After the initial
							configuration has been created the rules are followed and one observes
							how it evolves.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							The Game of Life is composed of a grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, <i>alive</i> or <i>dead</i>.
							Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that
							are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in
							time the following transitions occur:
							<ol style="margin-left:40px;margin-top:10px;">
								<li>1. Any live cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population</li>
								<li>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
								<li>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
								<li>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							Usually, live cells are colored and dead cells are white, making it
							easy to see what the current state of the game is. This application
							uses an image as the initial state of the game and uses different rules
							to determine if a cell (or pixel) is alive or dead.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							Each pixel's color is represented by three numbers representing the red, green, and blue components, using the <a style="color:#085dad;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#Numeric_representations">RGB color model</a> each
							component ranges from 0 to 255.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							There are many ways we can choose to determine if a pixel is alive
							or dead. For example, we could call a pixel alive if one of the
							components is above an arbitrary number. We could say any pixel that has
							a red component above 200 is alive. This makes an easy visual
							representation of the cells with more red are alive. Or we could call a
							pixel alive if one of the components is divisible by a specific number.
							This looks more arbitrary, but causes more interesting animations when
							the game of life is simulated.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							To make the animation look smooth when simulated I look for a
							neighbor that is in the state a cell is changing to. When a cell is
							dying it takes the color if a dead neighbor, and when a cell is being
							born it takes the color of a live neighbor. If there are no such
							neighbors then I break the rule and don't change the pixel's state that
							round.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							You can start and stop the simulation by clicking on the big
							picture. When you select a small picture it will auto start the
							simulation. You can also supply your own picture by entering a url and
							pressing the "Use Custom" button.
